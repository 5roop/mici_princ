MissingOutputException in rule Check in file /home/rupnik/mici_princ/snakefile, line 9:
Job 7  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
inspected_exbs_fixed/MP_05.exb
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
